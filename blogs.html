                    <p>Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. 
                        Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. 
                        Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly 
                        attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.</p>

                    <p>Two species of coffee plants, Coffea arabica and C. canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption. 
                        Arabica is considered a milder and more flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C. canephora. 
                        The flatter and more elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; 
                        Arabica must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 feet [600–2,000 metres]), it needs a lot of moisture, and it has fairly specific shade requirements. 
                        Latin America, eastern Africa, Asia, and Arabia are leading producers of Arabica coffee. </p>

                    <span>by admin / 2nd , Jan, 2022</span>
                    <p>Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under cultivation in the 15th century. 
                        One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an Arab goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. 
                        About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.</p>

                    <span>by admin / 1, July, 2022</span>
                    <p>Coffee was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. 
                        Many accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion. 
                        By the end of the 17th century, coffeehouses were flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and continental Europe. 
                        Until the close of the 17th century, the world’s limited supply of coffee was obtained almost entirely from the province of Yemen in southern Arabia. 
                        But, with the increasing popularity of the beverage, propagation of the plant spread rapidly to Java and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago in the 17th century and to the Americas in the 18th century. 
                        Coffee cultivation was started in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825.</p>

                    <a href="#" class="title">Coffee Processing</a>
                    <span>by admin / 19th, July, 2023</span>
                    <p>The ripened fruits of the coffee plant are known as coffee cherries, and each cherry generally contains two coffee seeds (“beans”) positioned flat against one another. 
                        About 5 percent of the cherries contain only one seed; called peaberries, those single seeds are smaller and denser and produce, in the opinion of some, a sweeter, more flavourful coffee. 
                        The cherries are processed by disengaging the coffee seeds from their coverings and from the pulp and by drying the seeds; all beans must be removed from their fruit and dried before roasting. 
                        Three techniques are used for processing the coffee: the dry, or “natural,” process, the wet (and washed) process, and a hybrid process called the semi-washed, or “pulped natural,” method. 
                        The coffee resulting from those processes is called green coffee, which is then ready for roasting.</p>

                    <a href="#" class="title">Coffee Grading</a>
                    <span>by admin / 28th, July, 2024</span>
                    <p>After green coffee has been hulled and processed, it is ready to be graded and sold for roasting. 
                        The practice of grading and classifying coffee gives sellers and buyers a guarantee concerning the origin, nature, and quality of the product to aid their negotiations. 
                        Each coffee-producing country has a certain number of defined types and grades—based on characteristics such as growing altitude and region, botanical variety, method of processing, 
                        roast appearance, and bean size, density, and defects—but there is no universal grading and classification system. 
                        Some coffee is shade-grown and is more likely to be certified organic. Fair Trade coffee, part of the larger Fair Trade movement, arose to ensure that coffee is harvested and processed without child labour.</p>
